# num-viz
Number visualization - similar to http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/pi/art/method.mhtml

A simple experiment with 2D graphics.

## Goal
The result shall at least look similar to the awesome [mother of circular pi visualisations](http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/visualising-the-infinite-data-of-pie)

There's even a nice [Numberphile video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPoj8lk9Fo4) on this kind of graphics.

## Principle
todo


## Color Selection
Selecting color schemes for visualizations should *not* only based
upon pure asthetic aspects, but on research...

[Cynthia Bewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/) gives serious advice on this topic.
