|image:gallery/circulizr-V0_5.jpg[V0.5, 400, circulizr-V0_5]
| Version 0.5 had only a single connectionNode per segment and only
straight connections between segments. Nothing was configurable.

|image:gallery/circulizr-V0_8.jpg[V0.8, 400, circulizr-V0_8]
| Version 0.8 had multiple connectionNodes, but still only straight
connections.

|image:gallery/CIRCULIZR_0_8_5_DEBUG-mode.jpg[V0.8.5, 400, circulizr-V0_8_5]
| Version 0.8.5 has multiple connectionNodes per segment, evenly spaced, +
enhanced by curved (Bezier) connections. It can visualize numbers only.
In the screenshot you can see the (light-gray) configurable
debugging raster.

The control point of all Bezier curves is the center (point-of-origin).

| Version 0.8.6 adds loads of configuration parameters. You see two different versions
of 80 connections of PI with a 5.0f line thickness and white respectively black background.

| The old version of the logo. Man, that looked really awful.

| image:gallery/CIRCULIZR_0_9_-_3500-digits-of-pi.jpg[V0.9, 400, circulizr-V0.9]
| That's how our images look like when really crowded with data.
