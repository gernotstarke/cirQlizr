Here you find the design- and architecture _evolution_ of kbd:[cirQlizr],
from an unstructured mess to (decide-for-yourself).

== V-Zero: The Quick Hack
[cols="3,3a"]
|===
|image:evolution/structure-v0.png[V-Zero,300]
| The ealiest version was more of a "slightly structured script"
than a deliberately engineered system.

The `JFrame` subclass initializes the actual drawing class (`Graphic`),
everything else is shoved into that poor overburdened Java2D object...


[[V-One]]
== V-One: Separating View From Calculations
[cols="3,3a"]
|===
|image:evolution/structure-v1.png[V1,400]
| We introduced the concept of Segments.
|===


[[V-Two]]
== V-Two: Clarify the Domain

[cols="3,3a"]
|===
|image:evolution/structure-v2.png[V2,600]
| We modularized the domain and created the first unit-tests.
|===



[[V-Three]]
== V-Three:

[cols="4,3a"]
|===
|image:evolution/structure-v3.png[V3,600]
| We modularized the domain and introduced `DigiNode` as the connection
of a line with a Segment.


|===


[[V-Four]]
== V-Four: Configuration and Data-Provider

[cols="4,3a"]
|===
|image:evolution/structure-v4.png[V4,600]
| 1. Introduced `DataProvider` as an abstraction
for all kinds of data to be visualized.

2. Introduced `Configuration` class: The whole application is now configurable with a type-safe configuration
with a configuration-file (cirQlizr.config).

|===


[[V-Five]]
== V-Five: Building Blocks Hierarchy

[cols="3,5a"]
|===
|image:evolution/structure-v5.png[V5,300]
| We introduced a top-level structure with domain-, ui- and application component, as both the domain
and UI became quite complex.

|===



[[V-Six]]
== V-Six: More Flexibility in Domain

[cols="3,5a"]
|===
|image:evolution/structure-v6.png[V6,600]
| `DataProvider` became more elaborated (see below).
