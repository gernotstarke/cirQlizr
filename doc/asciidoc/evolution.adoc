Here you find the design- and architecture _evolution_ of kbd:[cirQlizr],
from an unstructured mess to (decide-for-yourself).

| The ealiest version was more of a "slightly structured script"
than a deliberately engineered system.

The `JFrame` subclass initializes the actual drawing class (`Graphic`),
everything else is shoved into that poor overburdened Java2D object...


[[V-One]]
== V-One: Separating View From Calculations
[cols="3,3a"]
|===
|image:evolution/structure-v1.png[V1,400]
| We introduced the concept of Segments.
|===


[[V-Two]]
== V-Two: Clarify the Domain

[cols="3,3a"]
|===
|image:evolution/structure-v2.png[V2,600]
| We modularized the domain and created the first unit-tests.
|===



[[V-Three]]
== V-Three:

[cols="4,3a"]
|===
|image:evolution/structure-v3.png[V3,600]
| We modularized the domain and introduced `DigiNode` as the connection
of a line with a Segment.


|===


[[V-Four]]
== V-Four:

[cols="4,3a"]
|===
|image:evolution/structure-v4.png[V4,600]
| We modularized the domain even further, separated domain from technology.

|===


[[V-Five]]
== V-Five: Top-Level Building Blocks

[cols="3,5a"]
|===
|image:evolution/structure-v5.png[V5,300]
| We introduced a top-level structure with domain-, ui- and application component.
The whole application is now configurable with a type-safe configuration.
