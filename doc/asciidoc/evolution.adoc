Here you find the design- and architecture _evolution_ of kbd:[cirQlizr],
from an unstructured mess to (decide-for-yourself).

| The ealiest version was more of a "slightly structured script"
than a deliberately engineered system.

The `JFrame` subclass initializes the actual drawing class (`Graphic`),
everything else is shoved into that poor overburdened Java2D object...


[[V-One]]
== V-One: Separating View From Calculations
[cols="3,3a"]
|===
|image:evolution/structure-v1.png[V1,400]
| We introduced the concept of Segments, having different colors
and a distinct size (_extend_).
|===


[[V-Two]]
== V-Two: Clarify the Domain

[cols="3,3a"]
|===
|image:evolution/structure-v2.png[V2,600]
| We modularized the domain and created the first unit-tests. Color
and Coordinate become domain-concepts.

The notion of `digiNodes` is introduced, as a `Collection` of
Java2D points in 2-dimensional space.
|===



[[V-Three]]
== V-Three: DigiNodes

[cols="4,3a"]
|===
|image:evolution/structure-v3.png[V3,600]
| We modularized the domain and introduced the `DigiNode` class,
representing the connection of a line with a Segment (where
the line will start or end at the corresponding segment).

These nodes have to be evenly distributed along
segments, which requires the number of nodes-per-segment to be known before
the digiNode instances can be created.

In addition, we need circular arithmetic to perform these calculations,
so the circle class had to be enhanced.


|===


[[V-Four]]
== V-Four: Configuration and Data-Provider

[cols="4,3a"]
|===
|image:evolution/structure-v4.png[V4,600]
| 1. Introduced `DataProvider` as an abstraction
for all kinds of data to be visualized (with a simplistic interface).

2. Introduced `Configuration` class: The whole application is now configurable with a type-safe configuration
with a configuration-file (cirQlizr.config).

|===


[[V-Five]]
== V-Five: Building Blocks Hierarchy

[cols="3,5a"]
|===
|image:evolution/structure-v5.png[V5,300]
| We introduced a top-level structure with domain-, ui- and application component, as both the domain
and UI became quite complex.

_Curved_ connections between `DigiNodes` are drawn as http://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/[quadratic Bezier] curves
with a single _control point_ (BCP). Determining an appropriate BCP proved to be tricky and required additional
circular arithmetic.
|===



[[V-Six]]
== V-Six: More Flexibility in Domain

[cols="3,5a"]
|===
|image:evolution/structure-v6.png[V6,600]
| `DataProvider` became more elaborated (see below) to allow connections other than pairs of consecutive numbers.
