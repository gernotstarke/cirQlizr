Here you find an overview of the internal
design/architecture of kbd:[cirQlizr].

[small]#Version of {docdate}#


== Introduction and Requirements
kbd:[cirQlizr] has originally been build as a private challenge in software
design.


=== Basic Usage

Prerequisites: Java runtime.

. A user wants to visualize data in circular manner. She configures some parameters
 and starts the system via the command line or the [Gradle] build system.

. A user wants to visualize own data in circular manner. She can provide
data in various ways (e.g. implement a subclass of a `DataProvider` or
supply data in csv or text file.

. A software developer wants to understand the architecture of kbd:[cirQlizr],
its internal structures and crosscutting concepts.


=== Quality Goals

[options="header", cols="1,2,4a,4a"]
.Quality-Goals
|===
| Priority | Quality-Goal | Scenario | Approach

| 1        | Flexibility
| kbd:[cirQlizr] supports multiple UI technologies, e.g:

* Java2D
* JavaFX
* <<svg, SVG>>
* <<Processing>>

| Strictly separate _domain_ from _technical_ components within
the software design, so UI-technology can be changed without modification
to domain parts.

| 2        | Flexibility
| Details of output devices (like resolution), number of lines/connections,
colors etc. can be configured.
| File-based configuration, handled by `Configuration` class.
|===


== Solution Approach

Adhere to the _separation of concern_ design principle:

* separate user-interface technology from the _domain_ of circular
computation, segments and connections

See <<Building-Blocks>> for details.

== Building Blocks

=== Whitebox Level-1

kbd:[cirQlizr] implementation has been split into three major
building blocks

|===
| Name | Explanation | Sources

| Application Controller  | Creates a valid configuration and
instantiates the domain- and technical components.
| `org.cirqlizr.Application`, `org.cirqlizr.configuration`

| Domain Calculation | Calculates the (logical) coordinates and shapes
of Segments and their sizes, connections and connection-nodes.
| `org.cirqlizr.domain`

| Domain Data | Provides data in either numerical or textual format to
the calculation.
| `org.cirqlirz.domain.data`

| <<graphical-output,Graphical Output>>
|
* Either renders an image on the screen (by using a UI toolkit
  like Java2D or JavaFX) or creates an image file (e.g. -><<processing>> or -><<SVG>>)
* Transforms logical to physical -><<coordinates>>.

| `org.cirqlirz.ui`

[cols="1a,3a", options="header"]
|===
| Interaction | Explanation
| main        | call main method of class `Application`
| init configuration | parse command line, read configuration file
  and create `Configuration` object
| check configuration | simple plausibility checks of domain-configuration,
e.g. is the available data sufficient to create the
configured number of connections?
| init segments and connections
| two collections have to be created: (see <<domain-terms>> for details)

* segments (with their coordinates and sizes (extends)), independend of any connections.
* connections - for which we need the connectionNodes on the respective segments.
| show | create the visual representation in one of the supported UI technologies,
e.g. Java2D, JavaFX, <<Processing, processing>> or <<svg,SVG>>.

== Concepts

[[domain-terms]]
=== Domain Terminology

[[coordinates]]
=== Logical and Technical Coordinate system

All calculations are initially performed by domain classes within
a logical coordinate system with typical mathematical orientation
(x and y axis point right/upwards). Within this coordinate system,
the circle where we create segments and connections has a
radius of 1000 units.

In the diagram you find one (Bezier) connection (green line) together
with its two ConnectionNodes and the Bezier control point.

=== Configuration of kbd:[cirQlizr]
kbd:[cirQlizr] expects configuration options to be specified
in the file `cirQlirz.config`, which is read upon startup.

TODO: Supply the filename as command-line parameter.

The comments provided in that file should be sufficient
to understand most of the parameters.

=== UI-Toolkits and Graphical Languages
kbd:[cirQlizr] currently supports Java2D, but is designed to support
JavaFX, SVG and Processing without code changes to its core.

==== Fundamental Graphics Primitives
// TODO

* Angle
* Arc
* Shape (Rectangle, Ellipse)
* Line and (Bezier) Curve


==== Java2D

==== Processing
The https://processing.org/reference/[Processing language^] contains many
constructs known from UI toolkits like Java2D.

== Glossary of Terms

BCP:: Bezier Control point.
cirQlizr:: Circular Visualizer
POO:: Point of origin (in a coordinate system)
value-set:: The set of (distinct!) values that are part of the data to be visualized.
In case of numbers, the value-set consists of the digits from 0 to 9.

[[processing]]
https://processing.org/[Processing]:: Programming language to create graphics. From their website:
"Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for
learning how to code within the context of visual arts."

A domain-specific language plus corresponding development and runtime tools to
describe and implement graphics, both in 2D and 3D. Processing is implemented
in Java and is available for JavaScript too. kbd:[cirQlizr] uses the Processing language
as one output format.

[[svg]]
http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/[SVG]:: Scalable Vector Graphics.
SVG is a markup language for describing two-dimensional
graphics.
