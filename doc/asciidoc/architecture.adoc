Here you (will soon) find an overview of the internal
design/architecture of kbd:[cirQlizr].

[small]#Version of {docdate}#

=== Introduction and Requirements
kbd:[cirQlizr] has been primarily build as a private design challenge.


==== Basic Usage

Prerequisites: Java runtime.

. A user wants to visualize data in circular manner. She configures some parameters
 and starts the system via the command line or the [Gradle] build system.

. A user wants to visualize own data in circular manner. She can either
implement (a subclass of) a DataProvider or supply data in csv or text file.

==== Quality Goals and Solution Approaches

.Quality-Goals
|===
| Priority | Quality-Goal | Scenario | Approach
| 1        | Flexibility
| kbd:[cirQlizr] supports multiple UI technologies, e.g:

* Java2D
* JavaFX
* SVG
* HTML5 or WebGL

| Strictly separate _domain_ from _technical_ components within
the software design.

| 2        | Flexibility
| Details of output devices (like resolution), number of lines/connections,
colors etc. can be configured.
| File-based configuration and Configuration class. 
|===

=== Solution Approach

Adhere to the _separation of concern_ design principle:

* separate user-interface technology from the _domain_ of circular
computation, segments and connections

=== Building Blocks
