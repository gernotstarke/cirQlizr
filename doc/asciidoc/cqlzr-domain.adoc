=== <Level-2> Domain

The classes shown in blue within figure <<cirqulizer-whitebox>> belong to the
technology-neutral domain-part of kbd:[cirQlizr].

A few noteworthy aspects:

. Data (e.g. digits or others) are handled via <<`Data Provider`>> instances.
. Domain Calculations: All domain calculations
are performed within a purely mathematical coordinate system
(with a resolution of currently 1000 units) and later transformed into one or more
technical coordinate systems having configurable resolutions.

Section <<coordinates, Concepts/Coordinate-Systems>> explains the details
of this _separation of concern_.
